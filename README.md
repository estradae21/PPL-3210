com.company.VPL interpreter in Java

Compile com.company.VPL.java and com.company.IntPair.java
To run in terminal: java com.company.VPL fileName.txt memorySize
memorySize is an integer value

Project 1 [first serious submission due by Monday, September 10]

Implement com.company.VPL by starting from the given file com.company.VPL.java found in the com.company.VPL folder at the
course web site (supported by the little class com.company.IntPair.java), which (along with some other
useful stuff) does the irritating task of replacing symbolic labels by memory indices.
To begin, download com.company.VPL.java and com.company.IntPair.java to your working folder.
The given code assumes you are calling it from the command line. If you aren’t, you’ll
need to change the code in obvious ways.

Put in code to implement all the operations. The Be sure to test your program thoroughly.
At a minimum, run it on all the programs given in the com.company.VPL folder, plus your program from
Exercise 3. The file someUnitTests does a sequence of simple tests of some commands,
and you should be able to easily determine the output it should produce to compare to
what your program actually does produce. If you submit your work when it is not working
as desired on these com.company.VPL programs, you should also explain which ones have problems and
describe what you are planning to do next to fix your program.
As you’re working on this project, remember that this work will directly help you to
prepare for Test 1, which will ask you to read, write, and execute com.company.VPL code, as well as to
add new features to the com.company.VPL language.

When you are ready to submit your work (and recall that a serious first submission must
be done by the due date or you will never be allowed to submit it) email
shultzj@msudenver.edu with your file com.company.VPL.java as an attachment. And, yes, you must
do this program in Java, purely for my and your convenience. If there is any feature of the
program that you find difficult to do in Java, then you are probably doing things wrong!
In other words, implementing a language this primitive should only require very primitive
features of Java.
